This program is designed for image processing using the OpenCV library in the Java environment. It implements various algorithms for image processing, including:
Loading and displaying images;
Conversion to grayscale;
Using blur filters (Gaussian, Median, etc.);
Elevation of contours (for example, using the Canny algorithm);
Thresholding;
Morphological operations (erosion, dilation, etc.);
